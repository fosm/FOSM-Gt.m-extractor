Version 0.0000001 Mon Feb 13

This is my first running version of a C Program that accesses the fosm database.

The program loops ovre the main index of the nodex relation that contains the tags.
so the first key is the tag. There are more keys that are not used yet, they are :

1. TagName 
2. Value 
3. QuadTreeIndex
4. NodeID 

Here is an example to query the database : 
  GTM>zwr ^nodex("highway","service",*)
output is :
  ^nodex("highway","service","bacdbccbdabacad",1229063980)=""

Now my simple program uses the $Order function 

See the tags that I extracted so far here NodeX_TagKeys.txt 

FOSM contains many data relations, see Readme.relations, the numbers are from my database copy and may be old.

Thanks to 80n for his help and patience while I am learning this.
